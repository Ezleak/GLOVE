# GLOVE Project Credits

GLOVE Project started in early 2015 as an Internal Think Silicon Project, by [Panagiotis Apostolou](https://github.com/hiddenbitious). Such a project was necessary for Think Silicon back in 2015, since there was no other GL to Vulkan translation middle-ware in the open source community.

During 2016, GLOVE was able to support simple 3D demos as well as a set of KHRONOS conformance tests on top of Intel and NVidia Vulkan drivers. During 2017 & 2018 GLOVE was stabilized and extended to support the full OpenGL ES 2.0 feature set. On summer of 2018, it was decided to be uploaded to GitHub as a project of great potential that could be used by many people in Computer Graphics community.
